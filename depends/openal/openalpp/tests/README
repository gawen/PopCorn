Some small test/example programs. These are primarily for streaming, and might not work on all platforms yet..

simple - Play the file bee.wav. The basic test from the tutorial.

moving - Play the file bee.wav and moves it left/right (from the tutorial).

testmic - Read from the default input device and play it to a source placed on (0,0,0). Stop when return is pressed.

testsend - Load a file (gamebeginning.wav - not included) and send it through a socket, in packets of 1024 bytes. To be used in conjunction with teststream.

teststream - Connect a socket to a source and play it. Run testsend directly after running this.


More tests might be added in the future. The stranger tests that I used while developing have been removed as they would 
probably not be very interesting. For more examples, check the tutorials on the homepage.
